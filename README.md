# Employee Management Backend
This project is a backend service for managing employees, built with .NET 8 and using SQLite as the database. The service provides CRUD operations for employee data.

# Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK: Download and install .NET 8 SDK
- SQLite: SQLite is embedded within the .NET SDK, so no separate installation is required.

# Project Structure
The main folders and files in the project are as follows:

- Controllers: Contains API controllers to handle HTTP requests.
- Models: Defines the data models used in the application.
- Data: Contains the DbContext and database configurations.
- Migrations: Stores migration files generated by Entity Framework Core.

# Detailed Explanation
# Models
The Employee model represents the employee entity in the database. It includes properties such as Id, FirstName, LastName, Email, PhoneNumber, Position, and Department.

# Data Context
The EmployeeContext class inherits from DbContext and configures the database connection. It also includes a DbSet<Employee> to manage employee records.

```
public class EmployeeContext : DbContext
{
    public EmployeeContext(DbContextOptions<EmployeeContext> options) : base(options) { }

    public DbSet<Employee> Employees { get; set; }
}
```

# Migrations
Migrations are used to create and update the database schema. The initial migration is created with the command:
```
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
```
This generates a migration file in the Migrations folder, which is then applied to the database using:
```
dotnet ef database update
```

# Controllers
The EmployeesController handles HTTP requests for employee data. It includes actions for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting employees.

# Running Tests
To run the tests for the backend service, use the following command:
```
dotnet test
dotnet build
dotnet run
```
# Troubleshooting
- EF Tools Not Found: Ensure the EF Core tools are installed globally using .
```
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/tools"
```
- Database Connection Issues: Check the connection string in appsettings.json to ensure it points to the correct SQLite database file.


# Employee Management System Frontend
This project is the frontend application for the Employee Management System, developed using Angular and styled with CSS. The application interfaces with a .NET 8 API backend to manage employee data with CRUD operations.

# Project Overview
The Employee Management System Frontend allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee data. It connects to a .NET 8 API backend to fetch and manipulate data.


# Features
- View a list of employees
- Add new employees
- Edit existing employee details
- Delete employees
- Search employees by name, position, or department

# Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine
Angular CLI installed globally (npm install -g @angular/cli)


# Installation
- Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:snouae/ManagingEmployeeData.git
cd ManagingEmployeeData/EmployeeManagementFront
```

- install dependencies :
```
npm install
```

- Environment Configuration:

Ensure you have the correct API endpoint configured in your environment settings.

Create a file named environment.ts in the src/environments folder with the following content:

```
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:5200/api/employees' 
};

```
